This is experimental web interface for git, complementary to gitweb. 
It visualizes commit history graph and shows commit diffs.
It works in firefox, IE6 and Opera 8. It is not tested 
and most probably broken in any other browser. 
Since all UI is done in heavy javascript, 
it's rather demanding for resources on client side.

SETUP

cp *.html *.js *.pl *.css js.lib/* JSON/* <server-dir>

make sure that git-browser.pl and git-diff.pl are runnable as cgi scripts
make sure that html files are served as having UTF-8 charset

git-browser.pl checks the current directory for git-browser.conf,
if this file does not exists it looks for /etc/git-browser.conf
Everything in the file is optional, but with empty repository list 
git browser will show nothing. Sample variant of git-browser.conf
is provided as git-browser.conf.sample.

Format of the file:

path: overrides your $PATH
gitbin: <path to git binary, including the executable name>
git_temp: <path where git-diff.pl will create temp files>
http_expires: <value for CGI::header 'expires' parameter, for every responce>
warehouse: <path to fallback dir where to look for repos>
repos:
<repo-name> <repo GIT_DIR>
...
