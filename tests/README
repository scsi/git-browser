For running tests, load run-tests.html in your browser.

Tests expect git-browser.pl and this directory (tests) 
to be found at http://localhost/git-browser

Tests expect to find these two repositories in git-browser.conf: 

test tests/test.git
boo no-such-dir

The first one may be created by running mk-test-git.sh.
The second one is intentionally nonexistent (it is used
for testing error reporting)
